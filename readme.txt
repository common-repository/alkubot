**Alkubot will turn casual, hesitant visitors into a returning buyers.**

**Negotiator Bot**: Imagine that a potential buyer is browsing your store. But somehow he is not committed to buying so he is thinking about leaving. That’s when Alkubot comes to save the day. By starting a negotiation chat with the visitor, Alkubot can playfully sell your products by giving a discount. This way a hesitant buyer becomes a returning one.

**Optimized Conversion**: Most customers are price sensitive, that is why they search for another store when they see that the price of a product is too much. An already left customer can be attracted back to the site by using remarketing techniques and giving discounts. Alkubot saves these costs for your webshop while increasing conversion rate.

**Gamified Shopping**: Instead of using outdated and frustrating pop-ups, you can get your visitors buying from you with a gamified and interactive way. With the help of Akubot, visitors have to work for their discounts, this way, they value it more. Instead of fixed discounts, Alkubot helps the seller and the buyer finding the ideal discount rate.
